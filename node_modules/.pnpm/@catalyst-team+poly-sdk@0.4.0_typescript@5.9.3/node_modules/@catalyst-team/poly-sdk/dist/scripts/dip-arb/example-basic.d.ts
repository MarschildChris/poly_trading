/**
 * Example 14: DipArbService - Dip Arbitrage for 15m/5m UP/DOWN Markets
 *
 * Demonstrates the dip arbitrage workflow for Polymarket's short-term crypto markets:
 * 1. Scan for upcoming BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP UP/DOWN markets
 * 2. Auto-select and start monitoring a market
 * 3. Detect dip signals (price drops > threshold)
 * 4. Execute Leg1 + Leg2 trades for risk-free profit
 * 5. Auto-rotate to next market when current ends
 *
 * Strategy Overview:
 * - Leg1: Buy the dipped side when price drops >= dipThreshold (default 15%)
 * - Leg2: Buy the opposite side when combined cost < sumTarget (default 0.95)
 * - Profit: Total cost < $1 means guaranteed profit at settlement
 *
 * Environment variables:
 *   POLY_PRIVKEY - Private key for trading (required for execution)
 *
 * Run with:
 *   pnpm example:dip-arb
 *
 * Or monitor-only (no trading):
 *   npx tsx examples/14-dip-arb-service.ts --monitor-only
 *
 * With auto-rotate:
 *   npx tsx examples/14-dip-arb-service.ts --auto-rotate
